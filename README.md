# CPSC 552 Final Project

Code is entirely contained in the Jupyter notebook.

To recreate the virtual environment with `pyenv` use
```
pyenv local anaconda3-2024.10-1
```
and create the environment cloning the base environment, for example
```
conda create --name cpsc552project --clone base
```
Then activate and run the notebook using the environment's kernel.
